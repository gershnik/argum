## Unreleased

### Changed
- Updated CMake configuration to modernize it and allow local installation

## [2.4] - 2023-01-05

### Fixed
- Fixes to C++ module interface
  With MSVC recent bug fixes module now finally works again in 17.3

## [2.3] - 2022-09-05

### Fixed
- Workarounds for bugs in Visual Studio 2022, 17.3.3

## [2.2] - 2022-05-17

### Added
- Support for GCC 12

## [2.1] - 2022-04-04

### Changed
- It is now possible to require an argument to be "attached" to an option.
  That is, for options `-f` and `--foo` to require syntax `-fARG` and `--foo=ARG` and disallow `-f ARG` and `--foo ARG`.
  This can be handy if an argument is optional and you also have positional arguments. 
  See `Option::requireAttachedArgument` method.


## [2.0] - 2022-03-31

### Added

- You can now chose between using exception or expected values for error reporting. Define `ARGUM_USE_EXPECTED` to switch to expected values.
- Building with exceptions (and RTTI) disabled is supported too. This automatically implies `ARGUM_USE_EXPECTED`. On Clang, GCC and MSVC this mode is automatically detected when exceptions are disabled. On other compilers define `ARGUM_NO_THROW`.
- You can  customize the "terminate" function called when Argum encounters illegal arguments or usage. Define `ARGUM_CUSTOM_TERMINATE` and implement `[[noreturn]] inline void Argum::terminateApplication(const char * message)`. See README or Wiki for more details.

### Fixed
- Various minor bug fixes


## [1.1] - 2022-03-09

### Added

- Added convenience parsers that allow easy conversion and validation of options arguments and positionals
  * Integral parser function: `parseIntegral<T>`
  * Floating point parsing function: `parseFloatingPoint<T>`
  * Choice parser: `ChoiceParser`/`WChoiceParser`. Allows restricting input to a number of choices and returns index of the choice. 
  * Boolean parser: `BooleanParser`/`WBooleanParser`. Based on choice parser and converts things like "1"/"0", "on"/"off", "true"/"false" to boolean `true` or `false`

  If you are not using single-header/module distributions these live in `<argum/type-parsers.h>`
